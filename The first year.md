# The first year of my study
## 2025.9.14
>From now to the end of this study year. There are 10 months for me to get ready to start my research.

>I will make plans for every season, every month, every week and every day. I will.

>Ok, with no more words, I will make a plan for this year.

This year, I need finish all of my courses, and get a stable base for my future research.

1. Finish all of my courses.
2. Familarize with my research topic.
    1. Follow the senior LiYi.
    2. Familarize with the tools of the research. And arrange the deadline of every item.
3. Read the most advancing papers every week and exchange with my tutor and seniors.

Up to now, I realised that the time arrange may be too strict. I need plan flexible enough. So I can make the upper limit and lower limit.

Such as:
* 1 month: 
    * Expectation: 
        * 3 articles to be read carefully
        * 6 articles to be read roughly
    * Upper limit:
        * 5 articles to be read carefully
        * 8 articles to be read roughly
    * Low limit:
        * 2 article to be read carefully
        * 4 articles to be read roughly

I may list a list:
| Items | Expectation | Upper limit | Low limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Carefully read articles|3|5|2|
|Roughly read articles|6|8|4|
|Total articles|9|13|6|

Sum it up, this text is to be help me to arrange the life of my first year of study. More details will be written in the month plan and the week plan.

Latter, I will set the hyperlink to the month plan and the week plan.
